# Title: "One-Click Social Media Post Creator"

#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/SOpy0lgGN48

# Description:
    There's nothing more disturbing than posting same picture and caption repeatedly different social medias and manage them. Many of us waste time on it, many hire "Social Media Manager" to manage these type of tasks (basically it is again us wasting time instead doing something more creative, but this time we are earning money). To automate and get rid of this monotonous task, i decided to make this project as final project of CS50P. For beginning, it will use our chrome browser and detect where we are logged in and match them with database (supports X, Instagram and Facebook for now) and post image with or without caption OR plain text status on the mentioned sites(MOST IMPORTANTLY: LOG-IN CREDINTIALS ARE NOT REQUIRED AT ALL!) This will help mostly:
    1) Content Creators of YouTube, Tiktok to post on facebook, X, Instagram
    2) Organizations/companies/small businesses to advertise/post/reduce cost in this segment
    3) Educational Institutes & Instructors for better management over socials
    4) Memers
    5) Personal uses etc.
    I'm looking forward to improve it more with time if it really poses helpful tool for everybody. Have intentions to make different GUI for different type of users like for instructors, it will be "upload Videos, Notes, Slides, Subtitles, Video description" etc. to publish on edX, Coursera, Udemy, skillshare etc. platform OR for business purpose, specifically and especially working with Advertisements and publish them all over different social medias. To develop further, any kind of encouragement and support is much appriciated
